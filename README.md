## How to make a tailored TED talk: Data analysis on the key features of different types of TED talks

This is a data analysis work on over 1800 TED talks (with captions).
TED has been asking viewers to rate talks using rating words (beautiful, courageous, inspiring, confusing, etc.). With rich data of TED talks (captions, speaker information, talk key words, etc.), it would be interesting to see what are the key factors that contribute to e.g., an emotionally touching (rated as inspiring, courageous) vs a rationally convincing (rated as informative and persuasive) talk. Also, what gives rise to a negatively reviewed talks (talks that are frequently rated as unconvincing, confusing, long-winded, etc). These insight can not only provide prediction of ratings to a newly published TED talk but more important can serve as guidelines to speakers to make a tailored TED talk.
